To Secure wipe Hardrive (warning very slow process)

Download DBAN iso home edition from https://dban.org/

download and install/run unetbootin from https://unetbootin.github.io/

make a bootable live cd for dban

For Error "Could not find ramdisk image:/ubninit" see here https://github.com/unetbootin/unetbootin/issues/97

Basically Unetbootin doesn't configure syslinux.cfg properly, Solution: 

Edit syslinux.cfg, replacing all occurrences of "ubninit" with "ISOLINUX.BIN" and the one occurrence of "ubnkern" with "DBAN.BZI". It's case sensitive, so make sure it's all uppercase.

select DBAN when booting and select the drive to wipe by pressing space key then press F10 key.
